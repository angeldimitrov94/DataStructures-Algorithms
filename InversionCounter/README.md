# Inversion Counter

This Python script counts the number of inversions between input values. 
"The inversions of an array indicate how many changes are required to convert the array into its sorted form. When an array is already sorted, it needs 0 inversions, and in another case, the number of inversions will be maximum, if the array is reversed."

## Using the script
This script uses the input.txt file included as an example of an extremely example data set which to parse through. The input can also be via manually entered values entered as [0,...,n] in the format of a python list object, and can be passed in as a command-line argument if the script is invoked in such a way.
