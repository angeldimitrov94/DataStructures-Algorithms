# Recursive Integer Multiplication Algorithm
This C# application performs recursive integer multiplication on 2 n-digit positive integers. 
This algorithm is intended to be a much faster and optimized version of the traditional 'grade school' or 'long' multiplication algorithm for certain conditions. It uses Gauss's Trick to optimize the time complexity of the algorithm.

## Using the script
This console program can be run by running bin/debug/RecIntMult.exe
