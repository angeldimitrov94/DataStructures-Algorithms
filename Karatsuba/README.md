# Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm
This Python script performs Karatsuba multiplication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm) on 2 n-digit positive integers. 
This algorithm is intended to be a much faster and optimized version of the traiditional 'grade school' or 'long' multiplication algorithm for certain conditions. 

## Using the script
This script is intended to be invoked via command-line interface in the following format : 
>karatsuba.py [a] [b] 
Where [a] is the first operand and [b] is the second operand.
