# Mergesort Algorithm
This Python script implements the classic Merge Sort algorithm for sorting an unsorted array in O(nlogn) time. 

## Using the script
This script is intended to be invoked via command-line interface in the following format : 
>mergesort.py [0...n] 
Where [0...n] is the unsorted array to be sorted.
